RAISE-25 RESEARCH ARTIFACTS

This repository contains the empirical data, visualization scripts, and generated figures used to support the research paper. It provides the quantitative evidence for the claims regarding LLM scaling, emergent behavior, and cognitive impact.

FOLDER CONTENTS

- data/ - Contains research_data.json, which is the master dataset containing all the raw numbers used in the visualizations.
- figures/ - Contains the high-resolution PNG images generated by the scripts. These are the exact graphs used in the paper.
- scripts/ - Contains the Python source code used to generate each figure. Each script is standalone and reproducible.

VISUALIZATION DETAILS

1. Section 3: Attention Mechanism (section_3_attention.py)
Visualizes the internal self-attention weights of a Transformer model. It demonstrates how the model resolves pronoun ambiguity (e.g., linking "it" to "animal") using an attention heatmap.

2. Section 5: Empirical Scaling Laws (section_5_scaling.py)
Plots the relationship between Compute (FLOPs) and Loss. It demonstrates the "Power Law," proving that performance improvements are predictable functions of increased compute resources.

3. Section 5B: Emergent Capabilities (section_5b_emergence.py)
Contrasts the smooth scaling laws with "Phase Transitions." It shows how specific capabilities (like arithmetic) remain near-zero until a critical model size is reached, appearing suddenly.

4. Section 6: Forecasting (section_6_forecast.py)
Projects future benchmark performance (MMLU) using historical trend lines. It establishes a "Cone of Uncertainty" to model best-case vs. stagnation scenarios for policy analysis.

5. Section 7: The Trust Paradox (section_7_trust.py)
A dual-axis chart illustrating the inverse relationship between Model Accuracy and Human Verification. It quantifies the risk of over-reliance as models become more capable.

6. Section 8: Economic Impact (section_8_economic.py)
Visualizes the "Skill-Leveling" effect. The data shows that LLM tools provide a significantly larger performance boost to low-skill workers compared to high-skill workers, reducing the performance gap.
